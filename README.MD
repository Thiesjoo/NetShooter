# NetShooter

## Original idea
You spawn in a map which is grid based. There are several point of interest(Pokemon-gyms).
### Techincal
The map is divided in chunks(at least 1 POI per chunk). Each chunk creates a route between POI and sides, so it can connect

### POI Idea's
* People
  * NPC's(You can trade or fight with them)
  * Attackers(They will attack you
* Gym's
  * Update-gym: Update your pokemon's(They will get better defense)
  * DownloadMoreRam: Better speed
  * 
* Other
  * Rewards(Free hidden rewards which will earn you xp)


### XP
You can invest XP into your abilities to level them. They will get faster, give better result, 

### Abilities
Abilties are general and can be used at any time. (They have a range of course)
* nmap: scan for vurnerabilities in your opponent
* ifconfig: learn about your own strengths

*The rest of kali linux tools*

### UI
You have just the normal pokemon UI, but you also have a terminal.
In the terminal you can run all kinds 

### Fighting
You have different machines(Pokemons) and they have sub-abilities.
You also have evolutions: Linux(Different Distro's), Windows( WIndows 98, WIndows, 7), MacOS()

Every Machine also has levels which represent the hardware(Better cpu with higher level)

### Machines
* Linux
    * Very fast
    * You have to be high-level to use it correctly
    * Cryptidc errors

* Windows
    * Slow
    * Can be used by anyone
    * Crashes often

* MacOS


### Evolutions
* Linux
    * Manjaro(Fast, hard to use)
